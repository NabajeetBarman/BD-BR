# Bjontegaard Delta Bitrate (BD-BR)

Bjontegaard Delta Bitrate (BD-BR), proposed initially in 2001, remains one of the most widely and also misunderstood tools for the computation and comparison of codec compression efficiency of two or more video codecs. Initially proposed for BD-Rate and BD-PSNR savings calculation using PSNR as the choice of objective quality metric, many works in recent years have calculated and reported similar measurements using other objective metrics such as SSIM, VMAF and even MOS. Their understanding and usage, however, remains limited to mostly standardization activities with very limited work in the scientific literature studying the performance of such metrics under different conditions. Towards this end, in this paper we present three different studies related to BD-BR computation, both in terms of bitrate and quality savings. Different open source implementations, extensions and alternatives are evaluated on two different datasets, considering three objective quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM and VMAF) and subjective quality ratings (MOS scores). Based on various results and observations from this work, we present a set of recommendations on the use of existing BD-BR metrics as well as present various insights and opportunities for collaborative work on the development of more effective tools for codec compression efficiency evaluation and comparison. Additionally, all the evaluated metrics, their implementations and sample datasets used in this work are provided as an open source dataset for reproducibility of the results and future work in this direction.
